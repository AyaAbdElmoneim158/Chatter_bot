The project relies on the following key dependencies:

- **`emoji_picker_flutter`**: A Flutter package that provides an Emoji picker widget with 1500+ emojis in 8 categories. 
- **`get_it`**: Simple direct Service Locator that allows to decouple the interface from a concrete implementation and to access the concrete implementation from everywhere in your App.
- **`google_generative_ai`**: The Google AI Dart SDK enables developers to use Google's state-of-the-art generative AI models (like Gemini). 
- **`image_picker`**: Flutter plugin for selecting images from the Android and iOS image library, and taking new pictures with the camera.
- **`loading_animation_widget`**: Loading animation or loading spiner or loader. It's used to show loading animation when the app is in loading state or something is processing for uncertain time.
- **`lottie`**: Render After Effects animations natively on Flutter. This package is a pure Dart implementation of a Lottie player. 
- **`path`**: A string-based path manipulation library. All of the path operations you know and love, with solid support for Windows, POSIX (Linux and Mac OS X), and the web.
- **`provider`**: A wrapper around InheritedWidget to make them easier to use and more reusable.
